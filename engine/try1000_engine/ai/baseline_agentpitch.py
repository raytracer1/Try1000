# Baseline test strategy — hand-written, deterministic, used by both teams to
# validate the simulation framework before bringing LLMs back in.
#
# Wire-up: pass via `agent-pitch run --baseline playtest/strategies/baseline.py`.
# When that flag is set, CGP and PMEP are bypassed and the same file is used
# for team_a and team_b. The two teams play identical logic — match outcomes
# reveal asymmetries in the simulation, not strategy differences.

# be nested inside decide(), only the documented builtins.
#
# Behaviour overview (post-2026-04-22 role-aware rewrite):
#   - GK: hover near own goal, mirror ball y, punt to nearest forward when held.
#   - Carrier: shoot if within 25u of opp goal, pass if pressured, dribble.
#   - DEF off-ball: close down nearest opponent in own half (man-mark) when our
#     team doesn't have the ball; drift forward into half when we do.
#   - MID off-ball: press the carrier (if opp) or push forward to support
#     (if us).
#   - FWD off-ball: when we have the ball, run into space — away from the
#     nearest defender, toward opp goal. When opp has it, stay high (counter
#     threat) until ball comes loose.
#   - Closest non-GK to a loose ball chases it.
